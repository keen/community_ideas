# Dashboards as a Service

Right now, lots of people want a simple way to throw together a simple dashboard without the hassle of setting up a web project and hosting the solution somewhere. We would provide an easy way to create a hosted dashboard solution that leverages Keen's Data Explorer.

## Projects Used

 * [dashboards](https://github.com/keen/dashboards)
 * sinatra or rails? maybe something else?

## Features

 * Map named queries to a specific location in a dashboard
 * Link a named query to a chart type
 * Limit access to dashboards

## Hosting

Due to the mostly non-constant need to view dashboards, these can be hosted on Heroku without worrying about the paid tier.
