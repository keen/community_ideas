I want to create a community slack bot. Cause bots are cool, and can do fun things.

Also, just putting this out there, I don't want to use Hubot. Slack has a killer API, and it would be incredibly simple to write an express app to do everything we want. I actually think _not_ having the Hubot plugin ecosystem will be good - less options means less bloat means less useless chat-degrading things. Using slack's API will limit us to only `/slash` commands (not technically, but ideally).

### Things I want the chat bot to do

- `/coc` show the code of conduct
- `/karma joe` gives karma to Joe

### Things I don't want the chat bot to do

- `animate me` - use Giphy. Or just don't do this. It's low quality content
- `image me` - ditto. And just use giphy. Gifs are better than static images, if you must.

Please add/remove from this list as you have thoughts.
